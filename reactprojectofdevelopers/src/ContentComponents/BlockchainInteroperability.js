      Blockchain interoperability refers to the ability of different blockchain networks to communicate and share data with each other seamlessly. Interoperability is essential for realizing the full potential of blockchain technology by enabling cross-chain transactions and interactions.

    <p className="tutorial-text">
      There are several approaches to achieving blockchain interoperability, including:

    <ul className="interoperability-list">
      <li className="interoperability-item">1. Sidechains: Creating separate chains that are connected to the main blockchain, allowing assets to be transferred between them.</li>
      <li className="interoperability-item">2. Atomic swaps: Enabling direct peer-to-peer exchange of digital assets across different blockchains without the need for intermediaries.</li>
      <li className="interoperability-item">3. Cross-chain communication protocols: Developing standardized protocols for blockchain networks to communicate and share data.</li>

      Tokenization is the process of converting rights to an asset into a digital token on a blockchain. It involves representing real-world assets, such as real estate, stocks, or commodities, as digital tokens on a blockchain network. These tokens can then be traded, transferred, or exchanged just like any other cryptocurrency. Tokenization offers several benefits, including increased liquidity, fractional ownership, and enhanced accessibility to assets.
    </p>
    <h3 className="sub-heading">How Tokenization Works</h3>
    <p className="tutorial-text">
      1. Asset Identification: The asset to be tokenized is identified and evaluated.
      <br />
      2. Tokenization Process: The asset's ownership rights are digitized and represented as tokens on a blockchain.
      <br />
      3. Regulatory Compliance: Compliance with relevant regulations and legal frameworks is ensured.
      <br />
      4. Trading and Transfer: The tokens can be bought, sold, or transferred on blockchain-based platforms.
    </p>
    <h3 className="sub-heading">Applications of Tokenization</h3>

      Blockchain scalability refers to the ability of a blockchain network to handle an increasing number of transactions or users without sacrificing performance or efficiency. Scalability is a critical aspect of blockchain technology, especially as blockchain networks grow in size and popularity.
    </p>
    <p className="tutorial-text">
      There are various approaches to improve blockchain scalability, including:

    <ul className="scalability-list">
      <li className="scalability-item">1. Sharding: Dividing the blockchain network into smaller parts, or shards, to process transactions in parallel.</li>
      <li className="scalability-item">2. Layer 2 solutions: Implementing off-chain protocols or networks to reduce the burden on the main blockchain.</li>
      <li className="scalability-item">3. Optimizing consensus algorithms: Enhancing consensus mechanisms to achieve faster transaction processing.</li>
